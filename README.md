Made to make pushing updates for programs to minecraft easier. Won't be updated often
as I don't play Minecraft much anymore, and it works well enough for me in the state it is currently in.


# ComputerCraft File Server

A Simple (WIP) File Server that allows you to write a program for ComputerCraft and then send that file to the game without having to go through pastebin. 

##Set-up
Install [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` - Will install Flask if you don't already have it

(In game) Run [```pastebin get cLAuzykK dur```](http://pastebin.com/cLAuzykK) on a computer (dur standing for Download Upload Run)

Edit 'dur' and change the ip and port to the ip and port you are running this program on.



##Planned Features
- Split the config from the main program (Lua)
- Have some sort of version system (Python (Done) and Lua (WIP))

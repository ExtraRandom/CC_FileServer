Worked on it a little mostly for fun will update it once everything is ironed out.


Made to make pushing updates for programs to minecraft easier. No longer updated as I'm not currently playing Minecraft and the program works fine as it is (for me at least, you may experience some issues which you're welcome to fix yourself :) ).


# ComputerCraft File Server

A Simple (WIP) File Server that allows you to write a program for ComputerCraft and then send that file to the game without having to go through pastebin. 

##Set-up
Install [Python 3.5](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` - Will install Flask if you don't already have it

(In game) Run [```pastebin get cLAuzykK dur```](http://pastebin.com/cLAuzykK) on a computer (dur standing for Download Upload Run)

Edit 'dur' and change the ip and port to the ip and port you are running this program on.



##Planned Features
- Split the config from the main program (Lua)
- Have some sort of version systeme (Python and Lua)
